# Your Path To FAIRness - Passing the Tests

In this repository are a series of tutorials regarding how to move towards compliance with the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

Most tutorials are focused on becoming compliant with a single [FAIR Maturity Indicator](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics/tree/master/MaturityIndicators) Test.  This allows you to first execute a [FAIR Maturity Test](https://w3id.org/AmIFAIR) ([publication here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0184-5)) on your resource, and then focus only on those tests that failed. The tutorial will suggests one or more options for achieving success on that test, and will often provide different suggestions depending on the type of resource being tested.

# To Begin

If you have already run a [FAIR Maturity Test](https://w3id.org/AmIFAIR) then you probably want to go directly to the explanations and tutorials related to the tests you failed.  In that case, you should go to the [Index of MI Tests](./MI_Test_Tutorials).

If you are more generally interested in how to prepare for FAIR data publication, or have not yet run a [FAIR Maturity Test](https://w3id.org/AmIFAIR), then you should first [Choose Your Path](./GettingStarted.md) based on what kind of publisher you are going to be.
